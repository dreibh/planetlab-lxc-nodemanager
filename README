The PlanetLab NodeManager manages all aspects of PlanetLab node and slice management once the node has been initialized and configured by the Boot Manager. It periodically contacts its management authority for configuration updates. It provides an XML-RPC API for performing local operations on slices.

========================================
--- NOTES on debugging


(*) service nm restartdebug
this lets you restart the nodemanager in interactive mode, and with faster periods


(*) logs
logging is a bit confusing; the main recipient is 
    /var/log/nm
together with
    /var/log/nm.daemon (which should be empty)

but beware that part of the logs eventually end up in 
    /vservers/<slicename>/var/log/nm
as well as in here (although this should not be used anymore by now)
    /vservers/<slicename>/var/log/boot.log


(*) connecting with PLC
also, note that each time GetSlivers gets sucessfully fetched, it is saved in
    /var/log/getslivers.txt

When the connection is broken, for obscure reasons, all modules are
invoked anyway, but with an empty dict as data, triggering various
exceptions that complain about missing keys. In general these are red
herrings.
